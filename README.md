This repository hosts my adaptation of [ezProgressBar](http://ezprogressbar.sourceforge.net/)
to use the C++11 timer facilities.  Right now, I've only modified the and included
the ETA progress bar variant here.  I've also modified the interface slightly.
I may add more capabilities in the future, but right now, this is what it is,
a simple and effective progress bar for C++11 applications using the builtin language
facilities for timing.
